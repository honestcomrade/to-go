## Plan for the project:
* Build an API server using Golang, Postgres, and probably some cutting edge front end framework

## Learning Goals:
* How does routing work in Golang? 
* Does the standard lib make this easy?
* How to expose an api service using Golang?
* How to work with SQL in the form of Postgres
